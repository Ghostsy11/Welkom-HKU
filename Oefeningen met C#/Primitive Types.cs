//byte b = 1;
//int i = b;
//Console.WriteLine(i); that is good

//int i = 1000;
int i = 1;
//byte b = i;
//that is wrong or need to use cast
byte b = (byte)i;
// that is good be careful do not use more than 252,
// number coz you might get data lost if you use int i = 100 it only spicify the cast

//example 1
string number = "1234";
//example2 
var number = "1234";
//int i = (int)number;
int i = Convert.ToInt32(number);
//int i = Convert.ToByte(number); if you do that you will crash the program you can fix that by  with function TRY
// other example is 
string str = "true";
bool b = Convert.ToBoolean(str);// that not gonna work with casting,
Console.WriteLine(b);
// that why we convert it coz its not compatible like that it word
// you can not cast int to int  you need to convert it 
//we can not run the program coz its string the program tells us that so we need to convert it.

//{What are Logical Operations?Logical operations are part of Boolean algebra, which is often taught to students of computer science and electronic engineering at University.
//So, if youâ€™re not familiar with Boolean algebra, here is a brief introduction.In Boolean algebra, the value of variables can only be true or false, also denoted 1 and 0 respectively.
//Unlike elementary algebra, where the main operations are addition, subtraction, etc, the main operations of Boolean algebra are conjunction (AND), disjunction (OR) and negation (NOT).}
