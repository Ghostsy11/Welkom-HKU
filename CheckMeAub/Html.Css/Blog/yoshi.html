            <p>Ironically for a game set in ancient Greece, Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey is anything but Spartan. This
                epic-scale action-roleplaying game shines as a grand adventure through a magnificent and beautiful open
                world on a scale weâ€™ve rarely seen. With so few compromises between quantity and quality, Odyssey vaults
                over its predecessors to become the most impressive game in the history of the series.</p>
            <p>Assassinâ€™s Creed Odyssey begins more than 2,400 years ago at the onset of the Peloponnesian war: a
                decades-long struggle between Athens and Sparta for dominion over the ancient Greek world. Itâ€™s a
                fitting period to explore thatâ€™s rife with social and political intrigue, full-scale warfare on land and
                sea, and a tangible air of myth and legend. And after an astonishing 60-plus hours of galloping,
                sailing, and slicing through that historical-fiction sandbox, itâ€™s easy to see why it was worth fighting
                so hard over.</p>
            <p>Odysseyâ€™s world is the biggest and most vibrantly colorful of the series. Even though much of its
                playground is blanketed in the fickle blue waters of the Aegean sea, its playable acreage is immense and
                rivaled only by its sheer jaw-dropping beauty. Greece is a stunning series of picturesque locales:
                white-stone isles, eternally autumnal forests, sun-blasted desert islands, an endless expanse of beach,
                alabaster cities defended by titanic statues of bronze and stone, and the inviting, rolling waves of the
                open sea. These beautiful scenes explode into life thanks to a lighting system that still causes me to
                stop and snap a picture even all these hours later.
                Of course, as with virtually all grand-scale game worlds, flaws lurk just under the surface. They range
                from minor immersion-breaking hiccups like draw distance that never seems to be quite far enough to
                capture the view, textures that arrive moments too late, or slightly off-sync audio, to the more severe:
                getting terminally stuck on geometry, finding an unlootable lootable item, or having your tamed beast
                become untamed when you die and reload â€“ which may very well cause you to die and reload again if you
                happen to have had a tamed bear. Bugs like these were annoying, sure, but not quite frequent enough to
                sour me on exploring what has become one of my favorite open-world maps ever.</p>
